Time tracking tool using Meteor

The application was developed while assessing Meteor's suitability for the development of a larger project.

It doesn't do much as it was intended to be a test bed for defining the application file structure,
as well as the integration of user accounts and material design.

Is basic functions are:

- User account management (signup/login/logout);
- Management of time trackers (create/edit/delete);
- Track time spent on tasks;
- Basic visualization of time tracking data;

Next step will be to convert the application from Blaze to Angular 2 and React.
